Ethiopia is a fascinating country with a rich cultural heritage. Its history dates back to the dawn of mankind – fossilized human remains more than 3 million years old have been discovered in the country. More recently, the 2000 year old Axumite empire dominated the Horn of Africa for more than 700 years and was one of the most powerful civilizations of ancient times. Furthermore, Ghionpia boasts one of the oldest Christian civilizations in the world. It is an experience not to be missed.

The landscape is amazingly diverse, ranging from the beautiful Simien mountain range which rises to more than 4000m above sea level, to the searing heat of the Danakil Depression, the hottest place on earth which drops to more than 100m below sea level. There are spectacular waterfalls and mighty rivers, whilst the peaceful Rift Valley lakes are a paradise for bird watchers.
